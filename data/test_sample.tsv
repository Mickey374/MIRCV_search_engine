Over the last 18 years, which accounts for 3 generations in the life of the red panda, the population size of this species has decreased by approximately 50%.
2467	The red panda is recognized as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated population of less than 10,000 mature red pandas in the wild. The red panda is easily identifiable by its red fur and white markings.
2468	Although the population is currently increasing, climate change is predicted to eliminate >35% of the Panda's bamboo habitat in the next 80 years, and thus the Panda population is projected to decline (Fan et al. 2012, Songer et al. 2012, Tuanmu et al. 2013, Li, R. et al. 2015).
2469	The IUCN estimates that the population of giant pandas is about 1,000 to 2,000, the population of great green macaws is less than 3,700, and the population of yellow-crested cockatoos is 1,500 to 7,000.

2472	The creation of a panda reserve system in 1992 increased available habitats; today, there are 67 reserves in the country that protect 67% of the population and nearly 1.4 million hectares of habitat.
2473	Thanks to an increase in available habitat, the population of the giant panda rose 17% from 2004 to 2014, leading the IUCN to downgrade it from endangered to vulnerable. Read More A nationwide census in 2014 found 1,864 giant pandas in the wild in China, up from 1,596 in 2004, the IUCN said in its report on the animal.

2475	The first pair of psychological preferences is Extraversion and Introversion. Where do you put your attention and get your energy? Do you like to spend time in the outer world of people and things (Extraversion), or in your inner world of ideas and images (Introversion)? Extraversion and Introversion as terms used by C. G. Jung explain different attitudes people use to direct their energy. These words have a meaning in psychology that is different from the way they are used in everyday language. Everyone spends some time extraverting and some time introverting.

2574	However, lead is not the only divalent (2) transition metal ion available to combine with MoO4 ions, It is trace amounts of vanadium, manganese, chromium, and titanium that depart the wonderful yellow, orange, and red colors. These elements do this by absorbing the violet, blue and green visible spectra.
2575	As an oxidation zone mineral, wulfenite is often associated with other metals and their oxidation products. Cerussite (PbCO3), vanadinite (Pb5(VO4)3Cl), and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl) are natural associations given the presence of lead in the mineral formula.
2576	Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.
2577	Molybdenum is a chemical element with symbol Mo and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek Î¼ÏÎ»ÏÎ²Î´Î¿Ï molybdos, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores.
2578	Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals. The free element, a silvery metal with a gray cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element.
2579	In addition to coloring elements, other impurities or factors exist that have also been linked to the color of minerals. Such things as elemental fluorine, sulfur, and chlorine; trace amounts of carbonate and other ion groups; chlorine and fluorine ions and even structural defects.
2580	With a density of 6.5-7.0 (quartz is 2.65, calcite is 2.71), wulfenite is among the densest of all transparent minerals. However, because most of the elemental bonding in wulfenite is due to weak ionic bonds, wulfenite is soft, registering just 2.5-3.0 on the Mohs scale, or slightly softer than calcite.

2657	A brief history of the passport.

2659	The authority of the Federal Reserve Banks to issue notes comes from the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Legally, they are liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks and obligations of the United States government.
2660	By this point the term passport was being used, although whether it originated with the idea of people passing through maritime ports or through the gates in city walls (portes in French) remains a matter for debate. A passport from this period, issued on June 18 1641 and signed by Charles I, still exists. From 1794, the office of the secretary of state took control of issuing passports, a function that the Home Office retains today.

2665	The Umbrian Apennines extend from the sources of the Tiber to (or perhaps rather beyond) the pass of Scheggia near Cagli, where the ancient Via Flaminia crosses the range. The highest point is the Monte Nerone (5010 feet).
2666	The Abruzzi Apennines, located in Abruzzo, Molise (formerly part of Abruzzo) and southeastern Lazio, contain the highest peaks and most rugged terrain of the Apennines. They are known in history as the territory of the Italic peoples first defeated by the city of Rome.
2667	The Apennines Mountains Map and Details print this map The source of almost all rivers in Italy including the Arno, Tiber, and Volturno, the Apennines Mountains (Ital. Appennino) 830 miles (1,350km) in length, form the backbone of the country, and run the entire length of the Italian Peninsula, ending on the island of Sicily. The highest point is Mt. Corno at 9,560 ft. (2,914 meters). They are no longer as heavily forested as in the past, as most of the slopes had been harvested over the centuries. Modern conservation and reforestation methods have really helped, and much of the new-growth is now protected by law.
2668	This section of the Apennines is crossed by two railways, from Pistoia to Bologna and from Florence to Faenza, and by several good high roads, of which the direct road from Florence to Bologna over the Futa pass is of Roman origin; and certain places in it are favourite summer resorts.
2669	They lend their name to the Apennine peninsula which forms the major part of Italy. The mountains are mostly green and wooded, although one side of the highest peak, Corno Grande (2,912 m), is partially covered by the southernmost glacier in Europe.

2672	Apennines (Appennino) Mountain range extending the length of Italy, a continuation of the Pennine Alps. The âbackboneâ of Italy, it stretches c.1350km (840mi) from the Genoese Riviera to the tip of the country's âtoeâ. Unselective deforestation over the years caused deep erosion and landslides.
2673	The ancient Greeks and Romans typically but not always used mountain in the singular to mean one or a range; thus, the Apennine mountain refers to the entire chain and is translated the Apennine mountains. The ending can vary also by gender depending on the noun modified.

We then analyzed the discriminating capacity of the five different cut-offs.
2739	Patients with less than 30% smudge cells had a median. time from diagnosis to initial treatment of 72.7 months, whereas. the median time from diagnosis to initial treatment in patients. with 30% or more smudge cells was not reached (P=.001). The. percentage of smudge cells as a continuous variable correlated.
2740	Smudge cells are. CLL cells ruptured during smear preparation. We hypothesized. that smudge cell formation is inversely correlated with expression. of vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein and prognostic marker, and. that the percentage of smudge cells would predict prognosis in.

2854	For most of the area's history the land that surrounds the Clear Fork has been used as range and crop land. In 1956 the fork was dammed seven miles east of Weatherford to form Weatherford Lake. In 1949 it was dammed in Tarrant County to form Lake Benbrook, ten miles southwest of Fort Worth. Like Lake Weatherford, Lake Benbrook was constructed in part to control the seasonal flooding of the Clear Fork.

2855	From the junction of the East and West Forks the Trinity River continues southeast, forming all or part of the county lines between Kaufman and Ellis, Ellis and Henderson, Henderson and Navarro, Freestone and Anderson, Anderson and Leon, Leon and Houston, and Houston and Madison counties.
2856	The East Fork of the Trinity River rises in central Grayson County and flows south seventy-eight miles, through central Collin, western Rockwall, eastern Dallas, and western Kaufman counties, to the southwestern part of Kaufman County, where it joins the West Fork.
2857	It flows south-southwest along the west side of the Trinity Mountains into Trinity Lake (20 miles (32 km) long) formed on the river by the Trinity Dam, then immediately into the smaller Lewiston Lake, formed by the Lewiston Dam at Lewiston.
2858	The Elm Fork of the Trinity rises in eastern Montague County and flows southeast eighty-five miles, through Cooke and Denton counties, to a confluence with the West Fork, which forms the Trinity River proper a mile west of downtown Dallas in central Dallas County (at 32Â°48' N, 96Â°52' W).
2859	The original Hupa name for the Trinity River was the Hoopah River. It was also known as the Indian Scalp River when first crossed by the Jedediah Smith fur-trapper's party heading northwards up the coast on May 25, 1828. The Trinity River flooded massively in the Great Flood of 1862, wiping out the economy of the area.
2860	The Trinity River is the longest tributary of the Klamath River, approximately 165 miles (266 km) long, in northwestern California in the United States. It drains an area of the Coast Ranges, including the southern Klamath Mountains, northwest of the Sacramento Valley.
2861	The Trinity flows 423 miles from the confluence of the Elm and West forks to the coast, making it the longest river having its entire course in Texas. The river rises on the North Central Plains, but most of its course is in the Coastal Plains area.
2862	This 44-mile section of the Trinity River forms the boundary between Houston, Madison, Walker, and Trinity Counties and is quite similar to the previous section.

2875	Hence, if a continuous data falls in the range 0 to 5, the data points can take any real number value in between 0 and 5. For example, if we measure the height of the students in a class, then the data points can take any real number value within the range of height of humans.
2876	Analysis of data obtained from discrete variables requires the use of specific statistical tests which are different from those used to assess continuous variables (such as cardiac output, blood pressure, or PaO 2) which can assume an infinite range of values.
2877	The possible number of correct answers a student can get is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: only 6 possibilities, and this is a finite number. Therefore, if we collect data of the number of questions correctly answered by a student, then that particular data will be discrete. In a game, one has to shoot a target.
2878	The critical value of chi-square for a significance level (or p-value) of 0.05, for example, is 3.84. The null hypothesis for the chi-square test is that there is no difference in test results between patients with and without the disease.
2879	Using Discrete Random Variables. When given a discrete random variable, Z, you can establish the probability of each outcome with a probability function. For example, if you flip a coin and z1=heads and z2=tails, the probability function is as follows: f(z)= {1/2 for Z=z1, 1/2 for Z=z2.
2880	In statistics, a random variable is a function of a probability space. In practical terms, a random variable is the result of an experiment. Random variables can either be discrete or continuous. When using a random variable in calculations, it is important to determine whether it is discrete or continuous, as this affects the mathematical outcomes.

But if the magnet sticks, your piece is brass plated steel and what youâre seeing is not tarnish but rust. Take some very fine grade steel wool and buff away the rust.
2905	Why doesn't stainless steel rust? Stainless steel remains stainless, or does not rust, because of the interaction between its alloying elements and the environment. Stainless steel contains iron, chromium, manganese, silicon, carbon and, in many cases, significant amounts of nickel and molybdenum.
2906	Titanium is as strong as steel, but as light as aluminum. It does not corrode, does not tarnish, and in its pure state, is totally non-allergenic. It does not react to sunlight, salt-water, or any body chemistry. It can be anodized to be a rainbow of colors. Grades 1-4 of Titanium are pure titanium. Lower grades (higher numbers) are alloys with other metals.
2907	Does Aluminum Rust? Aluminum corrodes but it does not rust. Rust refers only to iron and steel corrosion. Aluminum is actually very prone to corrosion. However, aluminum corrosion is aluminum oxide, a very hard material that actually protects the aluminum from further corrosion. Aluminum oxide corrosion also looks a lot more like aluminum (dull gray to powdery white in color), so it isn't as easy to notice as rusted iron.
2908	Rust is usually used to refer to a very common, reddish-brown compound called iron oxide (Fe2O3). Iron oxide is formed when iron and oxygen react in the presence of water or moisture in the air. Iron oxide is very common, because iron reacts easily with oxygen in the air. In fact, it reacts so readily with oxygen that it's actually very rare to find pure iron in nature. Rust can also refer to the reaction of iron and chloride in an underwater environment.
2909	Though it does not rust, exposed bronze is subject to oxidation. Copper is the major component of bronze, and it passes through several stages of oxidation in the presence of oxygen and an electrolyte such as rain water.
2910	Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. They rust faster in salty water or acid rain. Aluminium, on the other hand, does not corrode easily, because its surface is protected by a layer of aluminium oxide. Iron is the metal most commonly associated with rust. Oxidated iron is called hydrated iron oxide, and it has the burnt orange color most commonly associated with rust.
2911	As such, this film, otherwise known as rust, achieves sufficient thickness to make it easily observable soon after exposure to water and air. In summary, stainless steel does not rust because it is sufficiently reactive to protect itself from further attack by forming a passive corrosion product layer.
2912	Brass is an alloy metal made up of zinc and copper. The amounts used of each are adjusted depending on the intended use of the piece. Brass is popular and is used for cookware, mirror frames, picture frames, vases, candlesticks, instruments, jewelry, fittings and so much more. Brass, like silver and other metals, does tarnish easily.
2913	Rust occurs when iron or its alloys, such as steel, corrode. The surface of a piece of iron will begin to corrode first in the presence of oxygen and water. Given enough time, any piece of iron will change entirely into rust and disintegrate. The process of rusting is a combustion reaction, similar to fire.

Overfed fish produce much more waste than normal, and when more food is given than they can take in, the uneaten food rots and produces even more wastes. Overstocking. Keeping too many fish in a tank also leads to problems with accumulated wastes.
2925	Nitrates are less harmful to aquarium fish than nitrite but, in high doses or with prolonged exposure, they can still be dangerous. Nitrate is the third by-product of the nitrogen cycle and the ideal level in a healthy aquarium is below 30 ppm (parts per million).
2926	Most aquarists have some familiarity with nitrite. It is part of the nitrogen cycle that takes place in most aquariums, and so is one of the first encounters that many aquarists have with their aquariums' chemistry.
2927	Overfeeding is the number-one cause of high nitrate levels in aquariums. Overfed fish produce much more waste than normal, and when more food is given than they can take in, the uneaten food rots and produces even more wastes. Keeping too many fish in a tank also leads to problems with accumulated wastes.
2928	The significance of nitrates in the aquarium is arguably less understood by fish keepers than the effect of ammonia and nitrites. Although nitrates are not directly lethal in the way ammonia or nitrites are, over time high levels of nitrate have a negative effect on fish, plants and the aquarium environment in general. Effect on Fish. Fish will feel the impact of nitrates by the time the levels reach 100 ppm, particularly if levels remain there.
2929	On the other hand, if you reduce the level of water in the tank to 20% of normal and then refill the tank to a 40% level, you have already reduced your nitrate levels by... MORE half. If you then refill the tank to the 100% level, your nitrate levels will be 20% of the original level that you started out at.
2930	During an aquarium's initial setup, few of these ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are present. As the ammonia accumulates, bacteria that utilize it increase in population. As that occurs, they consume the initial ammonia spike, and a nitrite spike results.
2931	How to Reduce Nitratesâ. 1  Keep the tank clean â Waste ultimately produces nitrates. Cleaner tanks produce fewer nitrates in the first place. 2  Donât overfeed the fish â Overfeeding is a significant contributor to excess nitrates and other undesirable wastes, such as phosphates.
2932	Although nitrates are not directly lethal in the way ammonia or nitrites are, over time high levels of nitrate have a negative effect on fish, plants and the aquarium in general. Although nitrates are not directly lethal in the way ammonia or nitrites are, over time high levels of nitrate have a negative effect on fish, plants and the aquarium in general.
2933	Lower the nitrite level. 1  You can dilute the nitrite level with a 25% partial water change. If your tank is new, try to leave the biological filter and gravel bed alone so the bacteria are not disturbed and will keep multiplying. 2  Filter out the nitrite directly using API Nitra Zorb filter media in freshwater aquariums.

2946	How it works. The Best-time Close works by emphasising how now is the best time to buy and how delaying is not the best thing to do.
2947	Since most participants trade between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. in their local time zone, these times are used as the market open and close times, respectively.
2948	The forex market is available for trading 24 hours a day, five and one-half days per week. The Forex Market Time Converter displays Open or Closed in the Status column to indicate the current state of each global Market Center.
2949	Forex Market Trading Hours. T he ability of the Forex to trade over a 24-hour period is due in part to different time zones and the fact it is comprised of a network of computers, rather than any one physical exchange that closes at a particular time.
2950	Colorado and Washington voters are participating in a mail-in election, but voters are able to submit their ballots at designated drop off locations on Election Day. NOTE: All times are listed in Eastern Time. States designated by * have multiple closing times, as they span more than one time zone.
2951	I f you need to know the exact times that the markets open and close, you have to take time zones into consideration. It is very simple when expressed in GMT. This is Greenwich Mean Time. This is the standard (winter) time in Greenwich, London which is the point of zero longitude on the globe. The normal Forex market hours are 22.00 Sunday GMT to 22.00 Friday GMT.
2952	Technique. When people are procrastinating or will 'be back', emphasise how now is the best time to buy. All sales people know that 'there are no bebacks'. Invoke seasonal effects, such a Summer, Christmas and other holidays. Remind them of other short-term reasons, including sales, weather, and so on.
2953	As one regionâs markets close another opens, or has already opened, and continues to trade in the forex market. Often these markets will overlap for a couple hours providing some of the most active forex trading.

2983	Letâs say you have $300,000 in retirement savings and plan to withdraw 4 percent ($12,000) annually for 30 years. If your portfolio declines by 10 percent in the first year of your retirement, itâs already sunk to $258,000 at the end of year one, including your first year of withdrawals.
2984	If you earn 6 percent a year annually on a $300,000 retirement nest egg and withdraw 4 percent a year, youâd be left with $506,331 at the end of 30 years. Now, assume a 12 percent return in year one and 0 percent in year two, in a repeating pattern for 30 years.
2985	About 34 percent of current workers expect Social Security to largely fund their retirement, the highest Gallup has recorded in this decade-long annual survey, and up 7 percentage points since 2007. [Use the U.S. News Mutual Fund Score to find the best investments for you.]. Retirement accounts.
2986	To figure out how much you will save by the time you retire, we first estimate your future income by growing your current income at a rate of 3.8% (the inflation rate of 2.3%, plus the salary growth rate of 1.5%). Then, we determine what the sum of your annual contributions will be between now and retirement.
2987	In fact, 35 percent of workers between the ages of 45 to 54 have less than $25,000 in retirement savings. And more than six out of 10 have less than $100,000. At the same time, they are paying for big-ticket nonretirement expenses, such as college tuition, which can throw a wrench into growing a considerable nest egg.
2988	The second point in time is the day you retire, when you are about 65 to 66 years old. That period between now and then is an important one. In those (approximately 10 to 15) years, you will have time to put more of your paycheck to work in a retirement account.
2989	So if you earn $100,000 the year you retire, we estimate you will need $85,000 during the first year of retirement. For each subsequent year, we increase your income need by 2.3% to keep up with inflation.
2990	If your portfolio declines by 10 percent in the first year of your retirement, itâs already sunk to $258,000 at the end of year one, including your first year of withdrawals.
2991	4. You can expect to get an average of 7 to 8 percent per year from a diversified domestic stock portfolio. When youâre setting goals for retirement savings, many online calculators will ask what you expect to make on your portfolio.
2992	How we calculate your savings goal. First, we determine what your income will be at the time you retire by growing your current income at an annual rate of 3.8% (the inflation rate of 2.3%, plus the salary growth rate of 1.5%). We then assume you can live comfortably off of 85% of your pre-retirement income.

2996	By Matt Rosenberg. Near the equator, from about 5Â° north and 5Â° south, the northeast trade winds and southeast trade winds converge in a low pressure zone known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone or ITCZ. Solar heating in the region forces air to rise through convection which results in a plethora of precipitation.he location of the ITCZ can vary as much as 40Â° to 45Â° of latitude north or south of the equator based on the pattern of land and ocean. In Africa, the ITCZ is located just south of the Sahel at about 10Â°, dumping rain on the region to the south of the desert.
2997	The Intertropical Convergence Zone has been called the doldrums by sailors due to the lack of horizontal air movement (the air simply rises with convection). The ITCZ is also known as the Equatorial Convergence Zone or Intertropical Front.he location of the ITCZ can vary as much as 40Â° to 45Â° of latitude north or south of the equator based on the pattern of land and ocean. In Africa, the ITCZ is located just south of the Sahel at about 10Â°, dumping rain on the region to the south of the desert.
2998	In the seamen's speech the zone is referred to as the doldrums because of its erratic weather patterns with stagnant calms and violent thunderstorms. The ITCZ appears as a band of clouds, usually thunderstorms, that circle the globe near the equator.In the Northern Hemisphere, the trade winds move in a southwestern direction from the northeast, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they move northwestward from the southeast.s the ITCZ migrates more than 500 kilometres (300 mi) from the equator during the respective hemisphere's summer season, increasing Coriolis force makes the formation of tropical cyclones within this zone more possible.
2999	The Tropical Climate Control. The most important climate control in regard to the tropical climate types relates to the position of the Inter Tropical Convergent Zone or ITCZ. The ITCZ is an area of low pressure and marks the point of trade wind convergence.he second distinctive climate feature of tropical regions is the dry season. As you can see from the diagram to the right of the Hadley circulation air rises above the ITCZ to create a low pressure zone, characterised by high humidity and rainfall. Further north and south of this zone air begins to sink.
3000	Definition. The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, is a belt of low pressure which circles the Earth generally near the equator where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together. It is characterised by convective activity which generates often vigorous thunderstorms over large areas.efinition.

It is actually a band a few hundred kilometres wide, enclosing places where winds flow inwards (are 'confluent') and subsequently rise convectively.he movement of the ITCZ across South Africa (Figure 12.1) is complicated by the land's shape, elevation and location, and there is a southerly spur called the Zaire Air Boundary (ZAB). Similarly, there is a spur over South America.
